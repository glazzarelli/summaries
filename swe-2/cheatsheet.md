## Introduction

<div class="multiple-columns">
<div class="column">

**Software engineering** is a field of computer science dealing with software systems: large and complex, built by teams, that exist in many versions, that last many years, and undergo changes.

The **goal** of software engineering is to develop **software products**. They are different from traditional products being intangible (difficult to describe and evaluate), malleable, and human intensive (do not involve any trivial manifacturing process).

According to **ISO/IEC 25010**, the software product qualities are:
- functional suitability (functional completeness, functional correctness, functional appropriateness);
- performance efficiency (time behaviour, resource utilization, capacity);
- compatibility (co-existence, interoperability);
- usability (appropriateness recognizability, learnability, operability, user error protection, user interface aesthetics, accessibility),
- reliability (maturity, availability, fault tolerance, recoverability),
- security (confidentiality, integrity, non-repudation, authenticity, accountability),
- maintainability (modularity, reusability, analysability, modificability, testability),
- portability (adaptability, installability, replaceability).
